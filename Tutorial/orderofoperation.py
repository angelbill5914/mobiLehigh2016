print "I will now count my chickens:"

# Prints out Hens and 30 afterwards
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6

#Prints out Roosters. Finds the remainder of 25 * 3 which is 3. 100 - 3 is 97!
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

#4 % 2 is 0. 0/4 is 0. Go left to right because it is all addition. I get 7
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 / 4 + 6


print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

#Retruns false because the logic isn't true
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#Prints out 5
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2

#Prints out -2
print "What is 5 - 7", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False"
print "How about some more."

#Returns true
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2

#Returns true
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2

#Returns false
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
